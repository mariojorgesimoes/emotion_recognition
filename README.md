Nowadays, facial recognition systems have become
more and more a part of society, with many applications
to its name. In this project, the link
between facial and emotional recognition was explored.
Emotional recognition is an important social
competence that empowers the individual to respond
adequately to the environment. It is through
facial expressions that this link is able to exist, since
they are representative of peopleâ€™s mental and psychological
state. This may have consequences in
their daily actions. Therefore, some emotions were
identified, namely anger, disgust, fear, happiness,
sadness, surprise and neutral, through the analysis
of a dataset of photographs that contain facial expressions
representing these same emotions.
